    <p>
        We are currently piloting our Intertemporal Choice
        experiment, and will be soon be needing <b>(paid)</b> test subjects.  The experiment should take
        no more than an hour of your time, and can result in up to $49 in compensation.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested, or happen to know someone that might want to participate,
        please do not hesitat to email us
        <a href="mailto:cdelveey@uci.edu" style="text-decoration: none;">here</a> for more information.

        <p>
The lab's ongoing research investigates the influence
of memories on behavior. Specific projects in progress examine
the roles of episodic and working memory in decisions
for reward, perceptual inference, drug choice and
addiction, and intertemporal choice, using computational
model-driven analysis of behavior and brain activity (via fMRI, but with plans for EEG and other methods).
    </p>
    <p><b>We're hiring!</b> If you're interested in working in the lab - as
        a research assistant, lab manager, or postdoc -
        please send me a brief (~2 paragraph) message
        describing your research interests. Include a CV
        and email addresses of up to three references.
        Postdoc candidates should include two or three
        relevant manuscripts (preprints are ok). </p>

        Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
